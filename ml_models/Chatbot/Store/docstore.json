Please have a seat. How can I assist you today?\n\n Thank you. Well, I've been feeling really down lately, and I think I might be experiencing depression. It's been affecting my life, especially in my work as an IT professional. I used to be passionate about my job, but now it feels like a constant struggle just to get through the day.\n\n   I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It takes courage to reach out for help, and I'm here to support you. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing in your IT job that makes it particularly challenging?\n\n Sure. One of the things that has been difficult for me is the lack of motivation. It's become increasingly hard to find any joy or enthusiasm for the work I used to love. I feel overwhelmed by even the simplest tasks and often find myself procrastinating or unable to concentrate.\n\n   I understand. Losing interest and motivation in activities you once enjoyed is a common symptom of depression. Have you noticed any other specific challenges related to your work?\n\n Yes, another major issue is the constant sense of fatigue. Even after a full night's sleep, I wake up feeling exhausted and find it hard to stay focused throughout the day. It's impacting my productivity and making it difficult to keep up with the demands of my job.\n\n   Fatigue can certainly have a significant impact on your overall well-being and work performance. I'm glad you mentioned it. Apart from these symptoms, are there any other aspects of your work that you find particularly distressing or overwhelming?\n\n I often experience a sense of worthlessness and self-doubt. I find myself questioning my abilities and skills, even though I have been successful in the past. It's challenging to maintain confidence in my work, and I'm afraid it's affecting my professional relationships and opportunities for growth.\n\n   It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of negative self-talk and self-esteem issues. These thoughts can be incredibly challenging to manage on your own. I want you to know that your experiences are valid, and we will work together to address them. Have you spoken to anyone at your workplace about what you've been going through?\n\n No, I haven't. I'm worried about the stigma around mental health issues, especially in the workplace. I'm afraid of how my colleagues and superiors might perceive me if I were to open up about my struggles.\n\n   I understand your concerns, and it's unfortunate that there can still be a stigma surrounding mental health. However, it's essential to prioritize your well-being and seek support. There might be resources or accommodations available at your workplace that can help you navigate this difficult period. We can discuss strategies to address these concerns and find ways to manage your symptoms effectively.\n\n That would be helpful. I really want to find a way to regain my enthusiasm for my work and start feeling like myself again. It's been a long time since I've felt genuinely happy and fulfilled in my career.\n\n   I'm glad to hear that you're motivated to make positive changes. We will work together to explore strategies tailored to your situation. In the meantime, I encourage you to practice self-care outside of work, engage in activities you enjoy, and try to establish a support system. Remember, you're not alone in this journey.\n\n Thank you for your understanding and guidance. It's reassuring to know that there's a path forward. I'm willing to put in the effort to overcome this and find a way back to a healthier state of mind.\n\n  Good morning. Please take a seat. How can I assist you today?\n\n  Hi. I've been feeling really low lately, and it's been affecting my work in the IT domain. I used to be passionate about my job, but now I can't find any motivation to do it. I feel like I'm constantly falling behind, and it's making me even more depressed.\n\n  I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It takes courage to seek help, and I'm here to support you.

Can you tell me more about the challenges you're facing in your IT job that are contributing to your current state?\n\n  Sure. One of the main issues is the high level of stress and pressure. The deadlines, the demanding clients, and the constant need to stay updated with new technologies\u2014it all feels overwhelming. I find it hard to keep up, and it's affecting my confidence in my abilities.\n\n  I can understand how the fast-paced and demanding nature of the IT industry can contribute to stress and feelings of inadequacy. It's important to acknowledge the challenges you're facing. Are there any specific aspects of your work that have been particularly distressing?\n\n  Yes, I'm also struggling with a sense of isolation. Most of my work involves sitting alone in front of a computer, and I rarely have opportunities for face-to-face interactions with colleagues. It feels lonely, and I miss the sense of camaraderie and collaboration I used to have in my previous job.\n\n  Isolation can certainly have a significant impact on one's mental well-being, especially when coupled with other factors. Feeling disconnected from others can exacerbate feelings of depression. Have you considered reaching out to your colleagues or superiors to discuss these concerns?\n\n  Not really. I'm afraid they won't understand or think less of me. Plus, there's a culture of competitiveness in my workplace, and I worry that showing vulnerability could jeopardize my position.\n\n  I understand your concerns, and it's unfortunate that these barriers exist. However, it's important to prioritize your mental health and well-being. Consider speaking to a trusted colleague or supervisor who might be supportive. Alternatively, seeking support from a professional outside of your workplace, like myself, can provide you with a safe space to explore these feelings and develop coping strategies.\n\n  That's a good point. I hadn't considered seeking support outside of work. I just want to find a way to balance my workload, reduce stress, and regain some sense of connection in my professional life.\n\n  It's great that you're open to exploring different avenues for support. Together, we can work on developing strategies to manage stress and find ways to establish a healthier work-life balance. It's important to remember that your well-being matters, and there are steps we can take to improve your current situation.\n\n  Thank you for your understanding and guidance.

One of the biggest challenges I'm facing is a lack of focus and concentration. It feels like my mind is constantly clouded, and it's hard to stay engaged in my tasks. I make more mistakes than usual, and it's affecting my productivity.\n\n  Difficulty concentrating is a common symptom of depression that can indeed impact your ability to perform at work. Have you noticed any other specific challenges that are making it difficult for you to function in your IT role?\n\n  Yes, another issue is a persistent feeling of exhaustion. Even with a good night's sleep, I wake up feeling tired and drained.

It takes courage to seek help, and I'm here to support you. Can you share more about how your depression is impacting your work in the IT field?\n\n  Certainly. One of the main issues I'm facing is a lack of motivation and passion for my work. I used to be really enthusiastic about technology and solving problems, but now it feels like a daily struggle just to get through the tasks. It's affecting my productivity and job satisfaction.\n\n  I understand how a loss of motivation can greatly impact your performance and enjoyment of your work. Have you noticed any other specific challenges related to your job that are exacerbating your depressive symptoms?\n\n  Yes, another significant challenge is the constant pressure to stay updated with new technologies and industry trends. It feels overwhelming to keep up with the rapid pace of change, and it often leads to feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy. I worry that I'm falling behind and not meeting the expectations of my role.\n\n  It's not uncommon to experience feelings of self-doubt and pressure in the IT industry, given the constant advancements and evolving nature of technology. These feelings can take a toll on your mental well-being. Have you had an opportunity to discuss these concerns with anyone in your workplace?\n\n  Not really.

Remember, you don't have to face this alone. We'll work together to help you overcome these obstacles and find a healthier and more fulfilling professional life. You deserve support and happiness in your IT career.\n\n  I remember when my very first psychiatrist (20 years ago) told me: \"You are not a damaged goods. Even though there is no one in your life now, there will be. In the mean time, lean on me.\" It was the most beautiful words I have ever heard in my life as I was always surviving alone without any help. I suddenly realize that this person cares of me, and his profession is nothing else but to provide special care and treatment for my disability. I started to really look forward into my special time with my therapy as a self care, \"my time\" to get rewarding spiritual healing.\n\nMy very first therapist always started our session by addressing to me by my first name. She always remembered what we talked about before. I felt special. Also, I saw tears in her eyes number of times during our session, it made me feel that she cares of my sorrows. She was very special person.\nThose little things do establish the trust between patient and therapist. This is a crucial point. I think....\n\nHis name is Sam.\n\nYou come home one day and he\u2019s lying on your couch, his bag propped at one end.\n\nYou don\u2019t know him but he seems at home.\n\nYou ask him to leave.\n\nHe smirks.\n\n\u201cMake me.\u201d\n\nEven if you call the cops and have them take him away, you can\u2019t afford to keep him away forever so you take matters into your own hands.\n\nYou cook healthy food. You buy a treadmill and make him run.\n\nYou try to wear him down, make living with you so insufferable that finally he leaves.\n\nOne day you come home and find his stuff has spread. His razor is propped up on your bathroom shelf, a thin dusting of hair on your sink. His jeans, smeared with ketchup and covered in crumbs, are in your laundry basket. His gaming console is hooked up to your TV.\n\nYou don\u2019t have the energy to fight him, not today.\n\nStepping over his shit you make your way to your room and quietly shut the door.\n\nYou don\u2019t want company, either. Not with him here.\n\nThe next morning you emerge to him taunting you.\n\nVulgar curses. Deprecating statements about how you aren\u2019t good enough, you\u2019re fat. You\u2019re ugly.

A 'friend' once told me I couldn\u2019t use my mental health as an \u2018excuse\u2019 because we all deal with anxiety and depression.\n\nI agree, we do.\n\nHere\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s normal to feel some form of anxiety or depression as a response to external challenges in your life (starting a new job, an abusive relationship, a break-up, a death, etc) and I\u2019m not diminishing the severity of the anxiety and depression these things can cause. Everyone can relate and understand your pain. But when there is no rational cause for the suffering, and it doesn\u2019t improve with time or by changing your circumstances, that\u2019s a mental disorder. And 'neurotypical' people cannot understand this.\n\nI\u2019ve yet to meet someone who has fully overcome mental illnesses (i.e clinical depression, OCD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, personality disorders) - as far as I can tell, it doesn\u2019t go away, you just learn to cope with it better. Recovery and relapse go hand in hand, and it takes every ounce of focus and intelligence you have to recover. It\u2019s exhausting fighting your own brain all the time.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is people constantly keep asking \u201cwhat is making you anxious/depressed?\u201d I have no idea! What is making you stable?! Why are you fine???\n\nI experienced life without mental illness briefly last year when I first started taking new meds and I can\u2019t even explain how different I felt. How easy everything was because half my brain wasn\u2019t preoccupied with unconscious bullshit. How much energy and passion I had for things. How connected I felt to everyone because I no longer felt different.\n\nI deluded myself into thinking I\u2019d \u2018recovered\u2019 due to hard work and effort, that it was in my control all along. But the truth is I didn\u2019t do anything different than I normally do, the positive thoughts and behaviour came naturally to me, the way I imagine it does for people who are mentally well.\n\nSome people think we are just doing this to ourselves by being too self-critical and irrational, and not looking after ourselves properly. \u201cYou just need to eat healthy, go to the gym, shower daily, get enough sleep, and think positive.\u201d Right. Those might be simple everyday tasks for someone without depression, but for someone with depression it is a real struggle. When you are in the depths of despair, personal care and positivity is the last thing on your mind. The first thing on your mind is \u201cWhat the fuck is the point?\u201d and trying to overcome that thought is a monumental task in itself.\n\nIt's not easy being close to someone with a mental illness. It\u2019s frustrating as hell, for everyone involved. It might seem like an \u2018excuse\u2019 for just being rude/ignorant, lazy, weak, awkward, negative, or a shit friend, but that\u2019s classic stigma. I explain this shit over and over because it\u2019s a valid reason. The struggle is constant, and when external life challenges coincide with this ongoing internal battle, it can easily get too much.

That doesn\u2019t mean we are weak. We are strong as fuck to keep fighting a silent illness every day on top of dealing with difficult life circumstances.\n\nIn my experience, any way of talking to someone who is depressed that expresses that you really care about them and want to understand what\u2019s going on inside their head is the best way to go. Don\u2019t ask trivial questions. Don\u2019t ask how they\u2019re doing and not listen to their answer. Pay attention to body language and energy levels as best you can. Listen to what they\u2019re not saying.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing the same therapist for 3 years now and she can tell when I walk in the door what kind of week I\u2019ve been having without me saying a word. And part of that is probably training and experience, but a big part of that is having seen me work through the ups and downs of being severely depressed and bipolar. She\u2019s seen me feel like I\u2019m on top of the world when I\u2019m in the midst of a hypomanic episode, at my worst when I was seriously considering suicide, and everything in between.\n\nIf I know someone cares about me, if I know that I\u2019m important to someone, I know that they only want the best for me. And it\u2019s hard to be offended by someone caring and wanting the best for you, no matter what they say.\n\nSo be honest with them about your concern for them, express in as many ways as you can that they are important to you, but also give them time when you ask questions about how they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s not always easy to put into words what\u2019s going on inside my head and body and I imagine that others who are experiencing depression have the same difficulty.\n\nAnd everyone else who has answered the question so far is also correct in my experience.\n\n  Hello, please have a seat. How can I assist you today?\n\n  Hi, thank you. I'm here because I've been struggling with depression, and it's affecting my work in the IT field. I feel like I'm in a constant state of sadness and lack the motivation to perform my job effectively.\n\n  I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It takes courage to seek help, and I'm here to support you. Can you provide more details about how your depression is impacting your work as an IT professional?\n\n  Of course. One of the main challenges I'm facing is the difficulty in concentrating and staying focused. I find it hard to absorb information and process complex technical tasks. It's affecting my ability to solve problems and meet deadlines, which is causing stress and further exacerbating my depressive symptoms.\n\n  I understand how difficulty concentrating can significantly impact your productivity and job performance. Have you noticed any other specific aspects of your work that are contributing to your depressive symptoms?\n\n  Yes, another significant issue is the constant pressure and high demands of the IT industry. There's an expectation to always be available, handle multiple projects simultaneously, and keep up with rapidly changing technologies. It's overwhelming and makes me question my abilities, leading to a feeling of being trapped in a cycle of stress and self-doubt.\n\n  It's unfortunate that the IT industry can be demanding and contribute to feelings of overwhelm and self-doubt. It's important to acknowledge these challenges. Have you discussed your struggles with anyone in your workplace, such as your colleagues or supervisor?\n\n  Not yet. I've been hesitant to share my feelings because I fear being judged or seen as weak. There's a culture of competition and an expectation to always be at the top of your game. I worry that opening up about my mental health would be detrimental to my career.\n\n  I understand your concerns, and it's unfortunate that there can still be a stigma surrounding mental health in the workplace. However, it's crucial to prioritize your well-being and seek support.

I have gone from being a very popular, vivacious, chatty, sociable person into what I can only describe as being a shade of grey. I believed anything was possible. the future looked so good!\n\nDepression then hit hard. Personality? What personality? It\u2019s gone. I think my individuality started to shrivel away with all the medication they make me take. I suppose I am somewhat stable, and I am managing not to end up back on the Psych ward, so that is good.\n\nI try to dare to dream, but it is so difficult when you really can\u2019t see a future at all. Sometimes I feel like I am just waiting to die.\n\nDepression changed my whole world, as well as my personality\n\nWho to talk to\nTalking to friends and family about your depression can be a very positive experience. Ideally, they\u2019ll respond with encouragement and support. Think about people in your life who are thoughtful and caring \u2014 the good listeners, the people you feel close to, comfortable with, and know you can trust.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure about talking to friends or family, start with your doctor or a trusted counselor, teacher, or spiritual advisor. The important thing is to talk to someone about how you feel \u2014 just saying it out loud might give you some relief.\n\nIf you don\u2019t feel you have someone in your life you can safely talk to or you\u2019d prefer to be anonymous, there are many helplines available with people ready to talk or text. Many helplines are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

There\u2019s no script to follow, and you don\u2019t have to share everything \u2014 only what feels right for you. Having an idea of what you want to say can make it easier. Here are some words to help start the conversation:\n\nI think something\u2019s wrong because I feel _____. I\u2019m worried that I may be depressed.

That would be really helpful to me.\n\nDo you want to talk about it? I\u2019m here when you\u2019re ready\nYou can\u2019t force someone to talk but knowing you\u2019re available can really help them feel supported.\n\nIf they haven\u2019t been forward with you about their depression, you may want to mention you\u2019ve noticed they\u2019re having a hard time and you\u2019re there", "start_char_idx": 26809, "end_char_idx": 30697, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beaf1cdd-9798-48b4-bb6c-80361f92ace3": {"__data__": {"id_": "beaf1cdd-9798-48b4-bb6c-80361f92ace3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "22fbecfb-fd93-4280-8de1-02be678c99f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "71fd9b74e97df594c863a5e00038ba8a4e8bb0b5420ce1f02ac3ab7341172a4d"}, "2": {"node_id": "64a00a18-c0de-4a7f-8296-8acaa149b16b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "34456aa020593fd9ea651c9b5fe46687f93b9c1aab7a93654526f40e26e283ef"}}, "hash": "a6e065787ce61e60d3372c105333ae3af40181a04d364ecbbc7ac3dd115744a8", "text": "you\u2019ve noticed they\u2019re having a hard time and you\u2019re there if they want to talk.

Sometimes just getting out of bed can be hard.\n\nAsking what you can do can really help them through their day.\n\nMaybe they\u2019re not eating well and you can pick up dinner. Maybe they need a morning call or text to ensure they get to work on time. Offering to do so is a way to let them know it\u2019s OK to seek help.\n\nSometimes you just need to listen.

Her answer to me:\n\nNo longer able to feel true happiness - not the real happiness she recalls being able to feel before her depressive state started;\nthere are moments that she feels as though the the depression has lifted slightly, or cleared a little, but not enough to call it true happiness;\nduring these moments of clarity, she\u2019s aware that there\u2019s something wrong with her. She dreads the feeling that the inevitable darkness will once again fall into place and she\u2019ll lose the clarity. Back to numbness and anxiety. This dread therefore tinges how she feels - constantly.\nShe feels as though she\u2019s handling life with gloves on. She can get a rough idea of what she\u2019s supposed to feel, but is not really able to touch the actual feeling itself, if that analogy makes sense to you.\n\nFrom an outsider\u2019s perspective and from a parental view, it\u2019s truly heart wrenching to see her try to grasp any real feeling. It\u2019s like watching a blindfolded person struggling to see. She knows that \u201csight\u201d is out there, but no matter how she twists and turns and peers, the best she gets is patches of lighter darkness.\n\nThe once happy, bubbly, talkative, curious, inventive, thoughtful individual has been replaced by an irritable, uncommunicative, shell of a person. We see the outside, seemingly \u201cnormal\u201d person, but the person that once was, is missing. My daughter is trapped in tangled veils of shifting darkness struggling to find any feeling at all, let alone happiness.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even feel real sadness anymore\u201d, she said to me when her beloved pet died. She cried about a day later, when one of the veils of darkness lifted, but I was struck by the apathetic nature of her grief. Most ranges of emotion - gone. Except anger. She\u2019d LOVE to feel sadness! She\u2019d love to feel anything at all. She\u2019d love to FEEL.\n\nSo, episodes of happiness, you ask? No. Just brief spells of \u2026\u2026. lift, that\u2019s it. And I mean brief. A few minutes - time enough to take a few breaths, that\u2019s it. Then she\u2019s gone again. I haven\u2019t heard her laugh - a real laugh in years. An occasional smile that never reaches her eyes, but that\u2019s all.", "start_char_idx": 30710, "end_char_idx": 34140, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"22fbecfb-fd93-4280-8de1-02be678c99f2": {"node_ids": ["958388cb-4f6a-4fdb-bea7-e5152e5d9cde", "8e50f74e-7da1-4a03-b42b-1600ee9005b0", "24007bb5-b2ed-4bdd-8f3a-9f972d010f48", "e507e145-91fc-4f17-8dd5-d55926ff7d7e", "7d77dd7b-cb40-4f03-ae89-10cfab58a88a", "138cc715-dbd5-4e6e-b389-2a2ad6871e09", "f24c4f7b-8237-4aaa-90d3-2df64aa668c4", "64a00a18-c0de-4a7f-8296-8acaa149b16b", "beaf1cdd-9798-48b4-bb6c-80361f92ace3"], "metadata": {}}}}
